                Splita is a website that splits large CSV and JSON files into smaller sizes for free. It allows users
                 to upload either a CSV or JSON files and lets them choose their own chunk sizes and later save the 
                 smaller sizes either on their local storage or any other storage  platform they choose.

                 Whilst a lot of people don't mind compressing large files, most cry about the poor quality of 
                  compressed files. Splitta offers users an opportunity to go around that and reduce the heavy load 
                  that is presented on processes by large CSV and JSON files.

                    To create a platform that lets users split large CSV or JSON files into smaller sizes called

                <h4>Team goals</h4>
                <p>To design and develop a free, fully functional and responsive website that will allow users to 
                    chunk large CSV or JSON files into smaller sizes whilst they choose their own sizes  and allow 
                    them to save and download them immediately or after some time.
                    The website will allow unauthenticated users to only browse the website  and view the
                     documentation while only authenticated users will get access to the dashboard and split their 
                     files.

                <h4>Scope</h4>
                <p>
                    This was not a very large project and since we were a group of designers we were able to finish
                     it in the stipulated time. The design work throughout the project was distributed well and 
                     effectively and GitHub issues and Trello were used to assign and manage tasks and coupled with 
                     regular google meet meetings we progressed well. Tasks were decided in this format:
                    User experience and interface design
                    User research and implementation
                    Brainstorming
                    Information architecture
                    Design system development
                    Wireframing and prototyping
                    Designing for responsivity
                    Iteration
                    Web development
                    Database schema
                    Choosing Framework
                    Front-end and back-end development
                    Testing
                    Deployment on Heroku
                    The entire process was however linear  and both designers and developers worked continuously to 
                    create the best product.

                <p>
                    A brainstorming idea was held for the entire team where we got to discuss the project scope in
                     full, individuals gave their introductions, limitations and expectation.
                    The session ended up  with a mood board element of  the website where everyone gave e rough 
                    idea of what the website might look like

                    All the interview   results were compiled and sent to other teammates, and they were able to come
                     up with the information architecture for the entire project

                <h4>User Research</h4>
                <p>
                    I was  responsible for the user research implementation. From a previous survey form that let us 
                    narrow down potential users, I was able to set up interviews  with potential users. With the
                    research plan as a guide I was able to conduct over 60% of video and call interviews. The entire 
                    process took less than a week  and the interview results were compiled and sent to the team 
                    members that were responsible for user journey mapping.
                    I chose . do research implementation because I believed whilst I was good at ux writing,
                    my research skills were rather not satisfactory so it helped me improve in conducting and 
                    carrying out effective and meaningful interviews..
                    The three main research methods used in this project are  surveys ,interview,Observation and 
                    secondary research.

                            I volunteered to do the project documentation because I believed it will help improve 
                            my ux writing skills as it also included the user experience documentation amongst 
                            other documentations. The whole documentation took about a week to complete and pass
                             to development . This also included writing the project's Readme.md file on Github.

                <p>
                    This was a very exciting and  fun project that i did in a project settings that added to my 
                    skills as a ui/ux designers. The following were my most memorable take homes from the project:
                    Collaborations need time ,decision making and clear instructions so that all work is done 
                    efficiently.
                    Timelines makes sure that deliverables are presented and achieved on time
                    Decide clearly and effectively at the beginning what should absolutely be in the projet and
                     what should be left out
                    When in a team setting, don't settle only for the parts you are good at , venture into the
                     unknown, grow and if not assigned work make yourself recognisable
                    Adaptation is key,learn as much as you can, grow and help others in your ux journey so that 
                    you can grow to.g

                     set guidelines and I have learnt a lot from it. If you like my work and would like to collaborate
